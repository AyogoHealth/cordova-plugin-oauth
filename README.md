cordova-plugin-oauth
====================

This plugin provides a mechanism for showing an OAuth flow in a secured
system-provided browser view and receiving the result via a Message event.

On iOS, this uses ASWebAuthenticationSession (iOS >=12),
SFAuthenticationSession (iOS 11), SFSafariViewController (iOS >=8, <=10),
falling back to Safari.

On Android, this uses Custom Tabs in the user's preferred web application,
falling back to their browser.

**Note:** This plugin might conflict with the Cordova In-App Browser plugin!


Installation
------------

```
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-oauth
```


Supported Platforms
-------------------

* **iOS** (cordova-ios >= 5.0.0)
* **Android** (cordova-android >= 8.0.0)


Usage
-----

1.  Trigger the plugin by opening the OAuth login page in a new window, with a
    window name that includes `"oauth:"`:

    ```javascript
    var endpoint = 'https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth?....';
    window.open(endpoint, 'oauth:google', '');
    ```

    By default, the plugin registers the app ID as a scheme to be used as the
    OAuth callback URL, and expects a host of `oauth_callback` (i.e., if your
    app's ID is `com.example.foo`, your OAuth redirect URL should be
    `com.example.foo:/oauth_callback`).

2.  The plugin will open the OAuth login page in a new browser window.

3.  When the OAuth process is complete and it redirects to your app scheme, the
    plugin will send a message to the Cordova app.

    The message begins with `oauth::` and is followed by a JSON object
    containing all of the key/value pairs from the OAuth redirect query string.

    ```javascript
    // Called from a callback URL like
    // com.example.foo:/oauth_callback?code=b10a8db164e0754105b7a99be72e3fe5
    // it would be received in JavaScript like this:

    window.addEventListener('message', function(event) {
      if (event.data.match(/^oauth::/)) {
        var data = JSON.parse(event.data.substring(7));

        // Use data.code
      }
    }
    ```

    The advantage of this implementation is that it can be made to work with
    Universal Links and App Links so that the same flow can be used in both
    mobile apps and web.
